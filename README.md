# Life AI - Bring your words to life using AI

Mudular python processes using zeromq to communicate between them. This allows mutiple chat models together and mixing of them into a mixer and out to twitch or where ever with ffmpeg/rtmp or anything ffmpeg can do. the nice part is using ffmpeg and packing audio/video into rtmp directly without OBS, and avoid all the overhead of need to decode it locally for broadcasting/streaming ðŸ˜‰.

Can build out endless prompt injection sources, news/twitch/voice-whisper listener/commandline/javascript web interface (that could have the video stream back and shared like youtube).

Thatâ€™s the goal, youâ€™ll see I am listing the parts as I build them, sort of have the core with llm/tts/stableDiffusion done + image subtitle burn in and prompt groomer for image gen, and generic for music usage (adding music tomorrow). twitch should be easy, I am parting out the parts of the consciousChat <https://github.com/groovybits/consciousChat> that seems more of a poc and experiment, nice, but this will remove the overhead and monolith design. It started to become too much to deal with putting it all into one app and threading everything. now each of these modules/programs are easy to understand for anyone and bypass python threading limitaitons.

## This uses the following models from huggingface

- <https://huggingface.co/facebook/mms-tts-eng> Facebook mms-tts-eng a model that is multilingual for TTS
- <https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/zephyr-7B-alpha-GGUF> A 7B parameter GPT-like model fine-tuned on a mix of publicly available, synthetic datasets.
- <https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5> Stable Diffusion 1.5
